# TODO.md

## Project Name: QIKS

**Goal:** Build a comprehensive, high-performance caching library in TypeScript with advanced features for versatile use in real-world applications.

### **Project Structure**

1. **Setup and Initialization**

   - [x] Initialize TypeScript project.
   - [x] Set up project directory structure:
   - [x] Configure `tsconfig.json` for optimal TypeScript development.
   - [x] Create README.md with basic project description and usage.

2. **Core Infrastructure**
   - [x] Design a `Cache` class with:
   - [x] Implement in-memory storage with basic CRUD operations.
   - [x] Write unit tests for all core operations.

### **Feature Development**

#### Phase 1: Basic Features

1. **Basic In-Memory Caching**

   - [x] Implement simple in-memory cache with hash map storage.
   - [x] Add unit tests for basic operations.

2. **TTL (Time-to-Live) Support**

   - [x] Add TTL expiration logic to cached items.
   - [x] Write tests to validate expiration functionality.

3. **Serialization**

   - [x] Support JSON serialization and deserialization for cached items.
   - [x] Add option to plug in custom serializers.

4. **Namespaces**

   - [x] Implement namespaces to isolate caches.
   - [x] Write tests for namespace isolation and operations.

5. **Cache Events**
   - [x] Emit events for `set`, `get`, `delete`, and `expire` actions.
   - [x] Write tests to ensure events are emitted correctly.

#### Phase 2: Intermediate Features

6. **Customizable Eviction Policies**

   - [x] Implement LRU, LFU, and MRU policies.
   - [x] Write tests for eviction policies with varying `maxSize`.

7. **Cache Dependency Management**

   - [x] Allow items to depend on other keys.
   - [x] Automatically delete dependent keys when the parent is deleted.
   - [x] Write tests for dependency chains.

8. **Expiration Callbacks**

   - [x] Add support for callbacks triggered on item expiration.
   - [x] Test callback execution under various scenarios.

9. **Key Observers**
   - [x] Allow observing changes to specific keys.
   - [x] Test observer callbacks for correctness.

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features

10. **Pattern-Based Preloading**

    - [x] Implement key preloading with pattern matching (e.g., `"user:*"`).
    - [x] Write tests to ensure preloading works as expected.

11. **Stale-While-Revalidate**

    - [ ] Serve stale data while fetching fresh data in the background.
    - [ ] Test revalidation logic under concurrent requests.

12. **Priority-Based Caching**

    - [ ] Add priority levels to cached items.
    - [ ] Test priority handling under eviction scenarios.

13. **Data Sharding**

    - [ ] Implement cache sharding for distributed systems.
    - [ ] Test sharding logic with multiple shards.

14. **Rate-Limiting with Dynamic Thresholds**

    - [ ] Use the cache to enforce dynamic rate limits (e.g., per user, IP).
    - [ ] Write tests to validate rate-limiting logic.

15. **Cross-Platform Synchronization**
    - [ ] Synchronize cache across multiple instances using Pub/Sub or WebSockets.
    - [ ] Test synchronization in distributed setups.

### **Optimizations and Benchmarking**

1. **Performance Benchmarking**

   - [ ] Create scripts to benchmark cache performance (CRUD, eviction, etc.).
   - [ ] Compare performance with existing libraries (e.g., `lru-cache`).

2. **Memory Optimization**

   - [ ] Analyze memory usage under heavy load.
   - [ ] Optimize storage structure to minimize overhead.

3. **Concurrency and Thread-Safety**
   - [ ] Add support for concurrent operations with locks or atomic structures.
   - [ ] Test thread-safety under stress conditions.

### **Documentation**

1. **User Guide**

   - [ ] Write detailed documentation for all features.
   - [ ] Include setup instructions and usage examples.

2. **API Reference**

   - [ ] Generate a comprehensive API reference with examples.

3. **Examples**

   - [ ] Add real-world use cases in the `examples/` directory.

4. **FAQ and Troubleshooting**
   - [ ] Create a FAQ section addressing common issues.

### **Community Contributions**

1. **Code of Conduct**

   - [ ] Write a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file.

2. **Contributing Guidelines**

   - [ ] Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with steps for submitting issues and PRs.
   - [ ] Encourage the use of conventional commits.

3. **Issue Templates**

   - [ ] Add GitHub issue templates for bugs and feature requests.

4. **Security Guidelines**
   - [ ] Create `SECURITY.md` to report vulnerabilities.

### **Release Plan**

1. **Alpha Release**

   - [ ] Implement basic features and release a beta version.

2. **Beta Release**

   - [ ] Add intermediate features and gather community feedback.

3. **Production Release**
   - [ ] Finalize all features and optimizations.
   - [ ] Write release notes and publish to npm.

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Integration with Popular Frameworks**

   - [ ] Provide plugins for Express, NestJS, and other frameworks.

2. **Plugin Architecture**

   - [ ] Allow developers to extend the library with custom plugins.

3. **Dashboard for Cache Monitoring**
   - [ ] Build a web-based dashboard to monitor cache usage and performance.
